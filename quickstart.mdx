## 1. Get your API Key

To communicate with the Linkryse API, you need a secret key.

1. Log in to your [Linkryse Dashboard](https://linkryse.com/dashboard).
2. Go to **Settings** -> **API Keys**.
3. Click **Create New Key**.
4. Copy the key (starts with `lryse_`).

<Warning>
  Keep this key safe! Do not share it in client-side code (browsers). It is meant for your backend server only.
</Warning>

## 2. Install the SDK

We recommend using our Node.js SDK for the best experience.

```bash
npm install @lryse/node
