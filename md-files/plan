You are absolutely correct.

**Documentation is Marketing.**

If a user (like a Marketing Manager at Coca-Cola) lands on your docs, they aren't looking for API endpoints. They are looking for: **"Can this tool do Geo-Targeting?"** or **"How do I set up a Custom Domain?"**

If the answer isn't in the docs, they assume the feature doesn't exist.

Here is the **Master Plan** for the Linkryse Documentation. We will structure it by **Feature Set**.

### The Structure Strategy

We will organize the sidebar into **6 Core Sections**:

1.  **Getting Started** (Onboarding)
2.  **Link Management** (The Core Product)
3.  **Smart Routing** (The Enterprise Features)
4.  **Platform Features** (Domains & Bio Pages)
5.  **Workspaces & Teams** (Admin Stuff)
6.  **Developers** (API & SDK)

*   `concepts.mdx` (Explain: Workspaces, Clicks vs. Events, Attribution)

#### 2. Link Management
*   `links/creating-links.mdx` (Basic creation, Custom Slugs)

#### 3. Smart Routing (The "Pro" Features)

#### 5. Workspaces & Teams
*   `administration/team-management.mdx` (Inviting members, Roles: Owner/Admin/Editor/Viewer)
*   `administration/sso.mdx` (Mention it's Enterprise only - good for sales)

### The `docs.json` Configuration

To make this structure appear in your sidebar, we need to update `docs.json`.

**Do you want to apply this structure now?**
If yes, I will give you the **JSON block** to paste into `docs.json`, and then we can start writing the pages one by one (starting with the most important ones like Custom Domains).
