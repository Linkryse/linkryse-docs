description: "Authenticate your API requests using Bearer tokens."

Linkryse uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Dashboard Settings](https://linkryse.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

## Bearer Token

Authentication to the API is performed via the `Authorization` header with a Bearer token.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_...
```

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## Example

Here is an example of an authenticated request to retrieve your workspace details:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://linkryse.com/v1/workspaces \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer sk_live_1234567890' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
