Linkryse is the modern link management infrastructure for marketing teams. We help you create, track, and optimize every click. 

Our API allows you to build powerful integrations, programmatically create short links, and retrieve granular analytics data.

## Base URL

The Linkryse API is built on REST principles and is served over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.

The Base URL for all API endpoints is:

```bash
https://linkryse.com/v1
```

## Getting Started

To start using the API, you'll need an API Key. You can generate one from your [Linkryse Dashboard](https://linkryse.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys).
