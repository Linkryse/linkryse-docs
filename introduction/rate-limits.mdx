The Linkryse API enforces rate limits to ensure stability and fair usage for all customers.

## Limits

| Plan | Rate Limit |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Free** | 10 requests / second |
| **Pro** | 50 requests / second |
| **Enterprise** | 100+ requests / second |

If you exceed the rate limit, your request will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

## Headers

We include headers in every response to help you manage your rate limits:

| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | The maximum number of requests you're permitted to make per second. |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current time window. |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |
