---

Linkryse uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. 

In general:
- Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. 
- Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). 
- Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Linkryse's servers (these are rare).

## Error Codes

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `200` | **OK** - Everything worked as expected. |
| `201` | **Created** - The resource was successfully created. |
| `400` | **Bad Request** - The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |
| `401` | **Unauthorized** - No valid API Key provided. |
| `403` | **Forbidden** - The API Key does not have permissions to perform the request. |
| `404` | **Not Found** - The requested resource doesn't exist. |
| `409` | **Conflict** - The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key). |
| `429` | **Too Many Requests** - Too many requests hit the API too quickly. |
| `500` | **Server Error** - Something went wrong on Linkryse's end. |

## Error Response Body

When an error occurs, the response body will contain a JSON object with a `error` field containing a specific code and a message.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "resource_missing",
    "message": "The link you requested does not exist."
  }
}
```
