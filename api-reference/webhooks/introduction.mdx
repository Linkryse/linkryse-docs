Webhooks allow you to listen for events on your Linkryse account so you can automatically trigger reactions. 

## How it works

Linkryse uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens in your account. Webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events like when a link is clicked, a lead is captured, or a domain verification status changes.

## Retry Policy

If your server returns a non-200 status code, we will retry the webhook delivery with an exponential backoff strategy:
- **1st retry**: 1 minute
- **2nd retry**: 5 minutes
- **3rd retry**: 30 minutes
- **4th retry**: 2 hours
- **5th retry**: 5 hours
- **6th retry**: 24 hours

After 6 failed attempts, we will disable the webhook endpoint.
