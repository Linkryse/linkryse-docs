Linkryse uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Dashboard Settings](https://linkryse.com/settings/apikeys).

## Bearer Token

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. Provide your API key as the basic auth username value. You do not need to provide a password.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer lryse_123456789...
